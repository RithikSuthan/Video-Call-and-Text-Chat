In our day to day life communication plays an vital role, as its evolution chatting and video conferencing blooms in the current era. As our project deals with this, we have implemented an live video transmission with a chat access concurrently. We used cv2, the advanced package of cv which supports us for video transmission, whereas cv wonâ€™t support video transmission. We included message access for the user. The server and client will connect through same IP address, so they can connect through the video call and with the chat access.
