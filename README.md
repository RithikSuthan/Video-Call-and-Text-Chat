## Video Call and Text Chat

### Problem Statement
In our day-to-day lives, communication plays a vital role, and with the evolution of technology, chatting and video conferencing have become essential means of communication. The objective of our project is to implement live video transmission along with chat access concurrently. We use the `cv2` package, an advanced version of OpenCV, to support video transmission, as OpenCV itself does not support video transmission. Additionally, we include message access for users, allowing them to communicate via text chat. The server and client will connect through the same IP address, enabling them to establish video calls and access chat functionalities.

### Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (cv2):** Used for video transmission and processing.
- **Socket Programming:** Used to establish communication between the server and clients.
- **Python:** Programming language used for implementation.

### Features
- **Live Video Transmission:** Users can establish live video calls with other users.
- **Text Chat Access:** Users can exchange text messages concurrently with the video call.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes client-server architecture for communication between users.
- **IP Address Connectivity:** Server and clients connect through the same IP address for seamless communication.

### Implementation
- **Server:** Acts as a central hub for establishing connections and managing video and chat sessions.
- **Client:** Connects to the server to initiate video calls and access chat functionalities.
- **Video Transmission:** Utilizes OpenCV (cv2) to capture and transmit live video frames between clients.
- **Text Chat:** Implements text-based communication between clients using socket programming.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for initiating video calls and sending/receiving text messages.

### Usage
- Run the server script to initialize the server.
- Run the client script on multiple devices to connect to the server.
- Initiate video calls and exchange text messages between clients.

### Future Enhancements
- Integration of encryption for secure communication.
- Implementation of additional features such as file sharing during video calls.
- Enhancements to the user interface for improved usability.
